# TimeCapsule Smart Contract

The TimeCapsule contract allows users to store messages securely on the blockchain. These messages are tied to the sender's address and can only be retrieved after a specified time has passed since they were deposited.

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Messages are stored on the blockchain, ensuring they remain secure and tamper-proof.
- **Time-Locked Retrieval**: Users can set a time lock on their messages, which prevents them from being accessed until the specified time has elapsed.
- **Ownership Control**: Only the contract owner can retrieve messages, adding an extra layer of security.

## Getting Started

To get started with the TimeCapsule contract, you'll need to have Node.js installed along with the Solidity compiler (`solc`). Follow these steps to deploy and interact with the contract:

1. Clone the repository containing the contract.
2. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
4. Deploy the contract to a testnet or mainnet.
5. Interact with the contract by calling its functions.
